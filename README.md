 Assignment 2

1. I added an "Intro" menu that tells the player about the game and
   what some of the buttons do. It also tells them what button to click
   to launch the pins.

2. I added an "Exit" scene that allows the player to either quit the game
   or to go back to the main menu to begin playing again.

3. I added a point system so the player could keep track of how many pins 
   they have successfully put into the rotating object.

4. I added an extra level where the rotator is a square instead of a cirlce
   and the pins shoot out of the spawner faster. This level is meant as level 2.
   However, I allowed the player to pick which shape they wanted to go to
   first from the main menu.

5. I added a slider bar inside the main game menu that would allow the player to
   speed up the rotation of the rotator. It goes from 100 to 500. I chose 500 because
   it seemed like a speed too fast to accuratly measure where the pin would go.
